# Deciphering-Market-Attribution-for-Optimal-Strategy

## Objective
Should a company invest in paid or organic media? How to attribute marketing channels?
Deeper dive on whether investment for paid advertising has paid off? Debate over value of owned media and paid media. Should the business invest in brand-building campaigns that grow the user base organically or should it continue investing into paid media. Evaluate attribution models and impacts of changing them.

## Analysis
1. Currently, the last-click attribution model is used. This is when 100% of the credit is assigned to the last touchpoint. When changing from last-click to first-click attribution model, there is a 20.6% decrease in revenue assigned to the marketing channels.
2. We are losing money on paid marketing per user per month. Recommendation to reallocate the marketing budget to unpaid and organic channels. This would save up to Â£4 per user per month on acquisition costs.
3. Revenue by owned and not-owned media follow the same trend but we are losing control. Recommendation to reallocate marketing budget towards owned media, such as introducing pull email marketing. This would reduce costs and increase profit.
